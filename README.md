# exquisite-corpse

A fun web game! Three players each have a part of the creature to draw: head, body, or legs. The catch: they need to draw their part without knowing what the others will look like! The pieces are combined at the end to make a finished "creature".

Our goal with this weekend project was to bring back this classic game from our childhoods in a digital format.

A great learning experience; first time using JavaScript and an exercise in lots of UI/UX.
